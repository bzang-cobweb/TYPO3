Zang BzaMain
==============================================================

## What's this?
This extension is the foundation for every new TYPO3 project. It should contain all the custom content elements, templates and configurations related to the website.

In the case of a multi-domain instance, each site should have its own "bza_main".

While the main site will be contained into the "bza_main" extension, every new site should have its "package" extension named in the format `site_sitename`.

## Contents of the extension
The extension provides a series of pre-configured settings for Containers, language setup, page templates, RTE presets, etc.

This is meant to accelerate the development and building of new websites.
